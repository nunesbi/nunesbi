## about me

Hey, I'm Bianca — but you can call me Bianquinha.

I’m a Software Engineering student at UFLA, focused on building solid fundamentals and understanding how things actually work under the hood.

I like solving problems, organizing chaos into logic, and writing code that makes sense — not just code that runs.

Still learning. Always building.
